# Programming in Haskell Study Group

## Why study Haskell

- Become a better programmer. 
    - Even if you don't use Haskell in production.
- Understand the FP constructs supported in you favorite languages.
    - Make better use of them.
- Functional programming is eating the world. 
    - It is better to be prepared.

## About this study group

- Distributed study group.
- Follows the contents of the
book
[Functional Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html).

## Basic way of working

- No master classes.
- Self-paced.
- Follow the [slides](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/Slides.zip).
- Make the exercises:
    - In your own time, at your own pace.
    - In person meetings.
- Discuss/make questions during:
    - In person meetings.
    - [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/EindhovenHaskellMeetup).

## Roadmap

- Part I and II of the book.
- One chapter a week.
- Part III: real-world Haskell applications.
